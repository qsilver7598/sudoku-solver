For my program I used python3 on the engr servers.

To run the file type in terminal:
	python3 sudoku.py
	
- The user will be navigating in the console with menu commands.
- Upon running the program, the user will be greeted with a menu to play or quit.
- Then the user will select from 3 pre-built Sudoku puzzles: easy, medium, and hard.
- When selected, the puzzle will be displayed and options to enter a number, verify,
	solve, reset, or quit will also be displayed.
- The verify option will dynamically verify the puzzle in it's current state is correct or not.
- The solve option will complete the puzzle dynamically.
- I did not have enough time to implement a way for the user to import their own puzzle, so if
	my solving algorithm and verifying algorithm need to be checked the grader can change the
	hardcoded boards within the GameBoard class and everything should work the same.
